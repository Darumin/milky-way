This is my first blog post! Isn't it *great*?

Some of my **favorite** things are:
* Going on hikes
* Meowing songs in public
* My turtle in a ninja costume

This blog was built with a <span className="body-accent">GraphQL</span> data layer. <br></br><br></br>
That basically means you can grab anything (using a fairly simple, easy-to-format querying language) from local storage, content management systems or even third-party databases at lightning speeds, and render it immediately on your <span className="body-accent">Gatsby</span> page.
